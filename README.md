# IOT-Lab-8
This lab focuses on building an IoT system where two Picos communicate through MQTT running on a Raspberry Pi. One Pico measures temperature and publishes the data to an MQTT topic, while the other Pico subscribes to that topic and reacts by turning on an LED when the temperature exceeds a 25 degrees  celcius.
